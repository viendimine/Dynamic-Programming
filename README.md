# Dynamic-Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping subproblems. It stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations, using either memoization (top-down) or tabulation (bottom-up). DP is efficient for optimization problems like shortest paths and knapsacks.
